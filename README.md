#### Nightly
Nightly Flatpak builds are available from [here][nightly-build].

## Requirements
Since only the Wi-Fi LAN medium is implemented, Packet requires Bluetooth to be enabled and the devices to be connected to a Wi-Fi network with mDNS.

## Translations
If you'd like to help translate Packet to your native language, you can do so using the [Weblate][translation-platform] platform.

## FAQ

#### Can't send to app from other devices

Your firewall may be blocking Packet's port. Enable *Static Port* in Preferences and allow it through the firewall. See issue [#35](https://github.com/nozwock/packet/issues/35).

#### "Couldn't open files"

This error occurs if the file is invalid (e.g. empty) or, on Flatpak, if you're sending files (via the Nautilus plugin) from a location Packet can't access.

Consider granting "All system files" access via Flatseal to allow sending from any location. See [Downloads folder keeps resetting](#downloads-folder-keeps-resetting) for details.

#### Downloads folder keeps resetting

In Flatpak, folder access is temporary and resets after a session restart because static access can't be requested. To set a permanent downloads folder, grant access in advance using Flatseal or run:

```sh
flatpak override --user io.github.nozwock.Packet --filesystem='/path/to/your/folder/here'
```

## Plugin Requirements

<!-- Don't change the heading since a link to it is being used in the app. -->

To use the Nautilus plugin, install the required packages:

- Ubuntu/Debian:\
`sudo apt install python3-dbus python3-nautilus`
- Fedora:\
`sudo dnf install python3-dbus nautilus-python`
- Arch:\
`sudo pacman -S python-dbus nautilus-python`
- Fedora Silverblue (rpm-ostree):\
`rpm-ostree install python3-dbus nautilus-python`

## Build
The project uses [meson] for its build system. You can build the project either natively or in a flatpak environment.

- Build and run via [meson]:
    ```
    # Build
    meson setup build_dir
    meson compile -C build_dir

    # Run
    meson devenv -C build_dir packet

    # Install & Run
    sudo meson install -C build_dir --no-rebuild
    packet
    ```
- Build and run via flatpak:
    ```
    # Build
    flatpak-builder --user flatpak_build_dir \
        build-aux/io.github.nozwock.Packet.Devel.json

    # Run
    flatpak-builder --run flatpak_build_dir \
        build-aux/io.github.nozwock.Packet.Devel.json \
        packet
    ```
